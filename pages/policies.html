                                In the event of a breach by you of any provision of this Agreement, including representations and/or warranties herein, we shall have the right in our sole discretion to delete, cancel, revoke, suspend, place on hold or lock, transfer or modify your registration of the domain name related to the breach (including by modifying your DNS settings), without prior notification to you and without regard to any period of time remaining in your registration term, including any future year(s) of registration you have already purchased. You acknowledge that we reserve the right to conclude that your conduct is in violation of the foregoing provisions and/or in breach of any provision of this Agreement, and we may arrive at such a conclusion even if it is based upon our opinion or mere suspicion or belief, without any duty to prove that our opinion or suspicion is well-founded, and even if our opinion or suspicion is proven not to be well-founded. Any action taken by us under this section may be taken by us in our sole discretion, without notice to you, without any obligation to refund fees paid, and otherwise without liability to you or to any third party for any such action. You acknowledge that there are no refunds of any amounts paid for a .med domain name which is subject to the terms of this Section.

                            <p>
                                This Agreement, your rights and obligations and all actions contemplated by this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the State of Ohio, as if the Agreement were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of Ohio, and without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the internal laws of the State of Ohio to the rights and duties of the Parties. Any action to enforce this Agreement or any matter relating to your use of a .med domain may be brought only in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (Eastern Division) or in the state courts of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, and each party to this Agreement expressly and irrevocably consents and submits to the jurisdiction and venue of such Courts, and courts of appeal therefrom, in connection with any such legal proceeding. 
                            </p>
                            <p> 9. Modifications </p>
                            <p>
                                You agree that we may revise, amend or modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement in our sole discretion. Any such change will be binding and effective immediately on the date on which the revised Agreement is posted on our web site, or, if notification of such changes is made available to you only by e-mail or United States mail, upon your receipt thereof. You agree to review our web site periodically to keep track of any such changes to the Agreement. If any such change constitutes a materially adverse change to you, you may request that your domain name registration be cancelled (so long as you are not in breach of this Agreement). You agree that such cancellation will be your exclusive remedy in such event, and you will receive no refund for any amount already paid for your registration. Except as otherwise expressly provided above, no provision of this Agreement may be amended or modified by you except by means of a written document signed by us. 
                            </p>
                            <p> 10. Premium and Renewal Pricing </p>
                            <p>
                                Certain domains may be designated, in our sole discretion, as premium domain names, or otherwise as non-standard pricing domains, and may be subject to variable pricing (e.g. not identical to the price of all other domain name registration renewals). You acknowledge that this Agreement provides clear and conspicuous disclosure to you that any Renewal Pricing (as such term is used in the Registry Agreement) may be variable and may be higher (or lower) than the registration price or any previous renewal price for any such domain. 
                            </p>
                            <p> 11. Appropriate Actions </p>

                                By “use,” “usage” or “using” your domain name we mean any use involving the Internet, including but not limited to website(s) and/or any pages thereof resolving at your domain, either directly or indirectly (including redirection, framing, pop-up windows/browsers, linking, etc.) and email distribution and/or reception.

                                This Agreement, together with all amendments or modifications, constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter hereof, and supersedes and governs all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications.

                                Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as creating any agency, partnership, joint venture or other form of joint enterprise between the parties. Our failure to require your performance of any provision hereof shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor shall the waiver by us of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall not render this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and such provision will be amended or construed so as to render it valid and enforceable and achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the objectives and intent reflected in the original provision. The provisions of Sections 1 through 12 of this Agreement shall survive the termination or other expiration of this Agreement.
